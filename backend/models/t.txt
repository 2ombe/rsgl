Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the MoMo API integration. We are excited to proceed with the integration and would like to confirm that we will indeed be needing to perform disbursements using the API.

Our company, Mtandao Ltd, provides a digital platform for admins who already operate collection centers to assist people in retrieving their lost items. These admins will utilize our platform to post found items, and through this collaboration, both parties can benefit. As the platform owner, we will receive a commission, while the admins will earn service fees.

When an item owner finds and claims their lost item, they will be required to pay the service fees using the MoMo platform. Once the payment is made, the system owner, Mtandao Ltd, will receive a commission, and the service fees will be disbursed to the admin who posted the item.

In addition, we would like to inquire if MTN can provide an API for items such as identity cards that are registered to individuals. It would be beneficial if, upon posting the item, MTN could send an SMS containing a link to claim the item to the owner of the ID card. This would streamline the process for citizens to easily retrieve their lost property. If this feature is possible, we would appreciate further details on how to integrate it.

We look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance with the integration process.

Thank you.

Best regards,
